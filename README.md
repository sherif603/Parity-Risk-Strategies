# Parity-Risk-Strategies
Apply Parity Risk Strategies on a variety of portfolio:Bonds, Equities, and Commodities.

Risk Parity Portfolio (RP):
- Risk parity portfolio is an investment allocation strategy that focuses on the allocation of risk, rather than the allocation of capital.
- A Risky Parity Portfolio, also known as equal risk contribution portfolio (ERC) is inverse volatility weighted portfolio if all pairwise correlations are equal,
in other words, which individual assets, in the case of equity and bond, have equal risk contribution to the portfolio risk.
- However, the Risk Parity portfolio was coined by Edward Qian (2015) when he examined the unbalanced risk allocation of traditional 60/40 allocation portfolios of bonds,
and stocks.
- Risk parity is a portfolio allocation strategy that uses risk to determine allocations across various components of an investment portfolio. 
The risk parity strategy modifies the modern portfolio theory (MPT) approach to investing through the use of leverage.
- A challenge with RP is that asset classes may carry some degree of risk exposure coming from other asset classes. 
The key point is that the RP portfolio should hold balanced risk allocation between the economic risk factors such as, 
growth and inflation risk that are the major drivers of portfolio returns.

Volatility
- Volatility is a statistical measure of the dispersion of returns for a given security or market index. 
In most cases, the higher the volatility, the riskier the security. 
- However, volatility is often measured as either the standard deviation or variance between returns from that same security or market index.
- Volatility is a measure of the price fluctuations of an asset or portfolio.

The Sharpe Ratio
- The sharpe ratio is the average return earned in excess of the risk-free rate per unit of volatility or total risk.

The Sortino Ratio
- The Sortino ratio is a variation of the Sharpe ratio that differentiates harmful volatility from total overall volatility by using the asset's standard deviation of negative portfolio returns—downside deviation—instead of the total standard deviation of portfolio returns. 
- The Sortino ratio takes an asset or portfolio's return and subtracts the risk-free rate, and then divides that amount by the asset's downside deviation. The ratio was named after Frank A. Sortino.
- The Sortino ratio = Portfolio Return - Target Return / Downside Risk
